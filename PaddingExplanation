In tensorflow 'SAME' padding is equivalent to zero-padding, meaning that zeros are added around the border of the image
if there is need in order to make each input pixel be mapped to the output. As a result if the stride of the
convolutional layer is 1, the input will have the same size as the output.
'VALID' padding means that only inputs that can be mapped without padding are mapped (meaning no padding).
